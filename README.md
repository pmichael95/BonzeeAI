## ABOUT ##

Bonzee is a 1 versus 1 board game that draws similarities to Go and other famous games.

This version implements an AI that utilizes alpha-beta pruning (minimax algorithm) and informed searches to play against a player.

### CONTROLS ###

Simply follow on-screen instructions to play the game. Initially you will be prompted to select settings for the AI. After that, the game will play automatically until your turn comes.

After your move, the AI will play. And so on.
